**Picker Wheel 3D**

This is a 3D picker wheel project made with OpenGL. The wheel can be divided into custom parts, and each part can contain a label of your choice. It’s designed as a small interactive tool that combines graphics programming with a fun use case: selecting a random option in a visually engaging way.

**Features**

Fully 3D-rendered spinning wheel using OpenGL.

Adjustable number of segments on the wheel.

Custom labels for each segment.

Camera movement with the mouse for exploring the wheel in 3D space.

Simple controls for movement and interaction.

**Controls**

W, A, S, D → Move around the scene.

Mouse → Rotate the camera.

Tab → Open the option menu where you can set how many segments the wheel has and what text is displayed on them.

**Technologies Used**

OpenGL (for rendering).

GLSL shaders.

C++ (core project language).

**Setup and Running**

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/picker-wheel-3d.git

2. Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE or build environment.
