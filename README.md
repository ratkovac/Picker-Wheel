A 3D Picker Wheel Program built with OpenGL. The wheel can be divided into customizable segments with user-defined labels. Pressing Tab opens the configuration mode to set the number of parts and their text. Movement is controlled with WASD keys, and the mouse is used for camera rotation. The program enables smooth navigation and interaction, making the wheel useful for decision-making, random selections, or demonstrations.
